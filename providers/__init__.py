"""
Provider registry for blockchain wallet lookups.

Each provider module exposes a class implementing BaseProvider (see base.py)
and registers itself in PROVIDERS below. To add a new blockchain:

  1. Create providers/<chain>.py implementing BaseProvider.
  2. Add a `matches(address)` classmethod for auto-detection.
  3. Import and register it below.

That's the only file that needs touching to plug in a new chain.
