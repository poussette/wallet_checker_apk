"""Solana provider, backed by the public mainnet-beta JSON-RPC endpoint.

No API key required. SPL token symbols/names are resolved via Jupiter's
public token list (best-effort, cached in-process); unknown mints just show
their mint address as the symbol.

Native SOL staked through the built-in Stake Program lives in separate
"stake accounts" owned by the Stake program, not in the wallet's own
balance, so it's invisible to a plain getBalance call. This provider looks
those up with getProgramAccounts filtered to stake accounts where the
wallet address is the "staker" authority (the one that controls the
delegation -- the same authority a wallet app uses to show "your" stake).
It does NOT additionally require the wallet to also be the "withdrawer"
authority: plenty of legitimate personal setups use a different withdraw
authority (e.g. a hardware wallet key kept separate from the hot wallet
used to manage delegation), and requiring both would silently drop those
real positions. Each entry's name includes the withdraw authority so you
can see when it differs from the wallet address and double-check who
actually controls redemption of that stake.

(This does mean that if this address is ever used as a *pooled* staker
authority managing delegation for other people's stake accounts, e.g. as
part of a staking service, all of those would be picked up too. That's a
real limitation with no fully reliable fix from public on-chain data alone
-- see "Limites connues" in the README.)

A stake account only earns rewards while actively delegated. Once
deactivated (fully unstaked, waiting to be withdrawn back to the wallet)
or mid-way through deactivating, its SOL is still sitting in the stake
account (not the wallet) but is no longer "at stake". This provider tells
the two apart using the account's activation/deactivation epoch versus the
cluster's current epoch, and tags them accordingly:
  - "staked"            : currently active or activating
  - "stake-withdrawable" : deactivating or fully deactivated, not earning
                            rewards anymore, ready (or soon ready) to be
                            withdrawn back to the wallet as liquid SOL

The reported amount is the stake account's actual current lamport balance
(not the on-chain `delegation.stake` figure), because that figure can stay
frozen at the historical delegated amount even after the SOL has already
been withdrawn back out. A fully-unstaked-and-withdrawn account is usually
left open on-chain holding only its rent-exempt reserve (~0.00228 SOL);
such dust balances are filtered out below so old, already-withdrawn stake
accounts don't show up as if they still held real money.

(Liquid-staking derivatives such as mSOL/jitoSOL are regular SPL tokens and
are already picked up by the normal token scan above.)
